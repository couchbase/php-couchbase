## Introduction

Connecting to a Couchbase bucket is as simple as creating a new Connection
instance.  Once you are connect, you may execute any of Couchbases' numerous
operations against this connection.

Here is a simple example of instantiating a connection, setting a new document
into the bucket and then retrieving its contents:

```php
$cluster = new \Couchbase\Cluster('localhost');
$db = $cluster->openBucket('default');
$db->upsert('testdoc', array('name'=>'Frank'));
$res = $db->get('testdoc');
var_dump($res->value);
// array(1) {
//   ["name"]=>
//   string(5) "Frank"
// }
```

## Documentation

An extensive documentation is available on the Couchbase website.  Visit our
[PHP Community](https://forums.couchbase.com/c/php-sdk) on
the [Couchbase](http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/sdk/php/start-using-sdk.html) website for the documentation as well as
numerous examples and samples.

To build PHP API reference, phpDocumentor have to be installed

    pear channel-discover pear.phpdoc.org
    pear install phpdoc/phpDocumentor

That will bring phpdoc command into PATH. The following steps assume that current directory is the root of this repository:

    ver=$(git describe | sed 's/^v//')
    rm -rf couchbase-php-client-$ver
    phpdoc --target couchbase-php-client-$ver --directory api

After that all reference documentation will be stored in couchbase-php-client-2.3.0, if current tag is 2.3.0.

## Source Control

The source code is available at
[https://github.com/couchbase/php-couchbase](https://github.com/couchbase/php-couchbase).

To execute our test suite, simply install and execute phpunit against your
checked out source code. Tests assume that you have Couchbase Server with
default bucket running on localhost (otherwise use environment variable
`CB_DSN`, `CB_ADMIN_USER`, `CB_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `CB_BUCKET`, `CB_USER`,
`CB_PASSWORD`. E.g. `CB_DSN=couchbase://192.168.1.42/ CB_BUCKET=travel-sample`).

```bash
curl -L https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit.phar > ~/bin/phpunit
chmod a+x ~/bin/phpunit
# or just 'dnf install php-phpunit-PHPUnit' on Fedora 24+

phpunit tests/
```

Integration tests require some prerequisites, so once they met, you can run integration
tests with:

```bash
phpunit integration/
```

It is also possible to run tests using [CouchbaseMock](https://github.com/couchbase/CouchbaseMock):

```bash
CB_MOCK=1 phpunit tests/
```

Server version guard might be specified by `CB_VERSION` (default is `4.6`). The tests which depend on functionality,
which is not supported by `CB_VERSION`, will be skipped automatically.
